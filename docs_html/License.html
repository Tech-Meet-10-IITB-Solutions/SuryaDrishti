<p>AstroNetra is licensed under the GNU General Public License Version 3</p>
<h1 id="gnu-general-public-license">GNU General Public License</h1>
<p><em>Version 3, 29 June 2007</em><br>
<em>Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;<a target="_blank" href="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</a>&gt;</em></p>
<p>Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license<br>
document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
<h2 id="preamble">Preamble</h2>
<p>The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other<br>
kinds of works.</p>
<p>The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take away<br>
your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General Public<br>
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a<br>
program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users. We, the Free<br>
Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of our software; it<br>
applies also to any other work released this way by its authors. You can apply it to<br>
your programs, too.</p>
<p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General<br>
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute<br>
copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you receive source<br>
code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of<br>
it in new free programs, and that you know you can do these things.</p>
<p>To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights or<br>
asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if<br>
you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it: responsibilities to<br>
respect the freedom of others.</p>
<p>For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee,<br>
you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make<br>
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these<br>
terms so they know their rights.</p>
<p>Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: <strong>(1)</strong> assert<br>
copyright on the software, and <strong>(2)</strong> offer you this License giving you legal permission<br>
to copy, distribute and/or modify it.</p>
<p>For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there is<br>
no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL<br>
requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will not<br>
be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.</p>
<p>Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified versions of<br>
the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is fundamentally<br>
incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change the software. The<br>
systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to<br>
use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have designed<br>
this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those products. If such problems<br>
arise substantially in other domains, we stand ready to extend this provision to<br>
those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of<br>
users.</p>
<p>Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States should<br>
not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on general-purpose<br>
computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special danger that patents<br>
applied to a free program could make it effectively proprietary. To prevent this, the<br>
GPL assures that patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.</p>
<p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.</p>
<h2 id="terms-and-conditions">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h2>
<h3 id="0-definitions">0. Definitions</h3>
<p>“This License” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.</p>
<p>“Copyright” also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of<br>
works, such as semiconductor masks.</p>
<p>“The Program” refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this<br>
License. Each licensee is addressed as “you”. “Licensees” and<br>
“recipients” may be individuals or organizations.</p>
<p>To “modify” a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in<br>
a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy. The<br>
resulting work is called a “modified version” of the earlier work or a<br>
work “based on” the earlier work.</p>
<p>A “covered work” means either the unmodified Program or a work based on<br>
the Program.</p>
<p>To “propagate” a work means to do anything with it that, without<br>
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under<br>
applicable copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private<br>
copy. Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification),<br>
making available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.</p>
<p>To “convey” a work means any kind of propagation that enables other<br>
parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer<br>
network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.</p>
<p>An interactive user interface displays “Appropriate Legal Notices” to the<br>
extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that <strong>(1)</strong><br>
displays an appropriate copyright notice, and <strong>(2)</strong> tells the user that there is no<br>
warranty for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that<br>
licensees may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this<br>
License. If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a<br>
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.</p>
<h3 id="1-source-code">1. Source Code</h3>
<p>The “source code” for a work means the preferred form of the work for<br>
making modifications to it. “Object code” means any non-source form of a<br>
work.</p>
<p>A “Standard Interface” means an interface that either is an official<br>
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces<br>
specified for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among<br>
developers working in that language.</p>
<p>The “System Libraries” of an executable work include anything, other than<br>
the work as a whole, that <strong>(a)</strong> is included in the normal form of packaging a Major<br>
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and <strong>(b)</strong> serves only to<br>
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard<br>
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code form.<br>
A “Major Component”, in this context, means a major essential component<br>
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on which<br>
the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an object code<br>
interpreter used to run it.</p>
<p>The “Corresponding Source” for a work in object code form means all the<br>
source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object<br>
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities. However,<br>
it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or<br>
generally available free programs which are used unmodified in performing those<br>
activities but which are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding Source<br>
includes interface definition files associated with source files for the work, and<br>
the source code for shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that the work<br>
is specifically designed to require, such as by intimate data communication or<br>
control flow between those subprograms and other parts of the work.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate<br>
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.</p>
<p>The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.</p>
<h3 id="2-basic-permissions">2. Basic Permissions</h3>
<p>All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on the<br>
Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This License<br>
explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified Program. The<br>
output from running a covered work is covered by this License only if the output,<br>
given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License acknowledges your rights<br>
of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.</p>
<p>You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without<br>
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey covered<br>
works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications exclusively<br>
for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works, provided that you<br>
comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do not<br>
control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered works for you must do so<br>
exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit<br>
them from making any copies of your copyrighted material outside their relationship<br>
with you.</p>
<p>Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions<br>
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.</p>
<h3 id="3-protecting-users-legal-rights-from-anti-circumvention-law">3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law</h3>
<p>No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under any<br>
applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty<br>
adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention<br>
of such measures.</p>
<p>When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention of<br>
technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by exercising<br>
rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you disclaim any<br>
intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means of enforcing,<br>
against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention<br>
of technological measures.</p>
<h3 id="4-conveying-verbatim-copies">4. Conveying Verbatim Copies</h3>
<p>You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any<br>
medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an<br>
appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this License and<br>
any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code; keep<br>
intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all recipients a copy of<br>
this License along with the Program.</p>
<p>You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may offer<br>
support or warranty protection for a fee.</p>
<h3 id="5-conveying-modified-source-versions">5. Conveying Modified Source Versions</h3>
<p>You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from<br>
the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that<br>
you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a<br>
relevant date.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this<br>
License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the<br>
requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who<br>
comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any<br>
applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,<br>
regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the<br>
work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have<br>
separately received it.</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal<br>
Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display<br>
Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which are<br>
not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not combined with<br>
it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution<br>
medium, is called an “aggregate” if the compilation and its resulting<br>
copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users<br>
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered work in an aggregate<br>
does not cause this License to apply to the other parts of the aggregate.</p>
<h3 id="6-conveying-non-source-forms">6. Conveying Non-Source Forms</h3>
<p>You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4 and<br>
5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under the<br>
terms of this License, in one of these ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br>
physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed on a<br>
durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a<br>
physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at least<br>
three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer support for<br>
that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either <strong>(1)</strong> a copy of<br>
the Corresponding Source for all the software in the product that is covered by this<br>
License, on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange, for<br>
a price no more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of<br>
source, or <strong>(2)</strong> access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no<br>
charge.</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written offer to<br>
provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only occasionally and<br>
noncommercially, and only if you received the object code with such an offer, in<br>
accord with subsection 6b.</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis or for<br>
a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in the same way<br>
through the same place at no further charge. You need not require recipients to copy<br>
the Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to copy the object<br>
code is a network server, the Corresponding Source may be on a different server<br>
(operated by you or a third party) that supports equivalent copying facilities,<br>
provided you maintain clear directions next to the object code saying where to find<br>
the Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding Source,<br>
you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as needed to satisfy<br>
these requirements.</li>
<li><strong>e)</strong> Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you inform<br>
other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work are being<br>
offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.</li>
</ul>
<p>A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the<br>
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the<br>
object code work.</p>
<p>A “User Product” is either <strong>(1)</strong> a “consumer product”, which<br>
means any tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or<br>
household purposes, or <strong>(2)</strong> anything designed or sold for incorporation into a<br>
dwelling. In determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases<br>
shall be resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a<br>
particular user, “normally used” refers to a typical or common use of<br>
that class of product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way<br>
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the<br>
product. A product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has<br>
substantial commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent<br>
the only significant mode of use of the product.</p>
<p>“Installation Information” for a User Product means any methods,<br>
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute<br>
modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of<br>
its Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued<br>
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with<br>
solely because modification has been made.</p>
<p>If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically for<br>
use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which<br>
the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the recipient<br>
in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is<br>
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be<br>
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply if<br>
neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object code<br>
on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).</p>
<p>The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a requirement to<br>
continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been<br>
modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been<br>
modified or installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification itself<br>
materially and adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules<br>
and protocols for communication across the network.</p>
<p>Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord with<br>
this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an<br>
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no<br>
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.</p>
<h3 id="7-additional-terms">7. Additional Terms</h3>
<p>“Additional permissions” are terms that supplement the terms of this<br>
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional<br>
permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they<br>
were included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable<br>
law. If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be<br>
used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by<br>
this License without regard to the additional permissions.</p>
<p>When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any<br>
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional<br>
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you<br>
modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you to a<br>
covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a<br>
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)<br>
supplement the terms of this License with terms:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a)</strong> Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of<br>
sections 15 and 16 of this License; or</li>
<li><strong>b)</strong> Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author<br>
attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed by works<br>
containing it; or</li>
<li><strong>c)</strong> Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring that<br>
modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as different from the<br>
original version; or</li>
<li><strong>d)</strong> Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors of the<br>
material; or</li>
<li><strong>e)</strong> Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,<br>
trademarks, or service marks; or</li>
<li><strong>f)</strong> Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by anyone<br>
who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual assumptions of<br>
liability to the recipient, for any liability that these contractual assumptions<br>
directly impose on those licensors and authors.</li>
</ul>
<p>All other non-permissive additional terms are considered “further<br>
restrictions” within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received<br>
it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License<br>
along with a term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a<br>
license document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying<br>
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms of<br>
that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive such<br>
relicensing or conveying.</p>
<p>If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place, in<br>
the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to those<br>
files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.</p>
<p>Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a<br>
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply<br>
either way.</p>
<h3 id="8-termination">8. Termination</h3>
<p>You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under<br>
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will<br>
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent licenses<br>
granted under the third paragraph of section 11).</p>
<p>However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a<br>
particular copyright holder is reinstated <strong>(a)</strong> provisionally, unless and until the<br>
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and <strong>(b)</strong> permanently,<br>
if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means<br>
prior to 60 days after the cessation.</p>
<p>Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently<br>
if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this<br>
is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any<br>
work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after<br>
your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of<br>
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your<br>
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to<br>
receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.</p>
<h3 id="9-acceptance-not-required-for-having-copies">9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies</h3>
<p>You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the<br>
Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a consequence of<br>
using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does not require<br>
acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you permission to<br>
propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe copyright if you do not<br>
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a covered work, you<br>
indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.</p>
<h3 id="10-automatic-licensing-of-downstream-recipients">10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients</h3>
<p>Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a license<br>
from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work, subject to this<br>
License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this<br>
License.</p>
<p>An “entity transaction” is a transaction transferring control of an<br>
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or<br>
merging organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity<br>
transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also<br>
receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or<br>
could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the predecessor<br>
has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.</p>
<p>You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted or<br>
affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee, royalty,<br>
or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and you may not<br>
initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging<br>
that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or<br>
importing the Program or any portion of it.</p>
<h3 id="11-patents">11. Patents</h3>
<p>A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this<br>
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus<br>
licensed is called the contributor's “contributor version”.</p>
<p>A contributor's “essential patent claims” are all patent claims owned or<br>
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that<br>
would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or<br>
selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would be infringed<br>
only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For<br>
purposes of this definition, “control” includes the right to grant patent<br>
sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.</p>
<p>Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent license<br>
under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell, offer for sale,<br>
import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of its contributor<br>
version.</p>
<p>In the following three paragraphs, a “patent license” is any express<br>
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an<br>
express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent<br>
infringement). To “grant” such a patent license to a party means to make<br>
such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.</p>
<p>If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the<br>
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge<br>
and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network server or<br>
other readily accessible means, then you must either <strong>(1)</strong> cause the Corresponding<br>
Source to be so available, or <strong>(2)</strong> arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the<br>
patent license for this particular work, or <strong>(3)</strong> arrange, in a manner consistent with<br>
the requirements of this License, to extend the patent license to downstream<br>
recipients. “Knowingly relying” means you have actual knowledge that, but<br>
for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a country, or your<br>
recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe one or more<br>
identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe are valid.</p>
<p>If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you<br>
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a patent<br>
license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them to use,<br>
propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent<br>
license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered work and<br>
works based on it.</p>
<p>A patent license is “discriminatory” if it does not include within the<br>
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the<br>
non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this<br>
License. You may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with<br>
a third party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make<br>
payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the<br>
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would receive<br>
the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license <strong>(a)</strong> in connection with<br>
copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or <strong>(b)</strong><br>
primarily for and in connection with specific products or compilations that contain<br>
the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent license<br>
was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.</p>
<p>Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied<br>
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you<br>
under applicable patent law.</p>
<h3 id="12-no-surrender-of-others-freedom">12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom</h3>
<p>If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)<br>
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the<br>
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy<br>
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent<br>
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you<br>
agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying from<br>
those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms<br>
and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.</p>
<h3 id="13-use-with-the-gnu-affero-general-public-license">13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License</h3>
<p>Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link or<br>
combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU Affero<br>
General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the resulting work.<br>
The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered<br>
work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License, section<br>
13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the combination as such.</p>
<h3 id="14-revised-versions-of-this-license">14. Revised Versions of this License</h3>
<p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU<br>
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit<br>
to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
<p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies that<br>
a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License “or any later<br>
version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and<br>
conditions either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the<br>
Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU<br>
General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free<br>
Software Foundation.</p>
<p>If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU<br>
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a<br>
version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.</p>
<p>Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However, no<br>
additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a result of<br>
your choosing to follow a later version.</p>
<h3 id="15-disclaimer-of-warranty">15. Disclaimer of Warranty</h3>
<p>THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.<br>
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES<br>
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM “AS IS” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER<br>
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF<br>
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE<br>
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE<br>
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</p>
<h3 id="16-limitation-of-liability">16. Limitation of Liability</h3>
<p>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY<br>
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS<br>
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,<br>
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE<br>
PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE<br>
OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE<br>
WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE<br>
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</p>
<h3 id="17-interpretation-of-sections-15-and-16">17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16</h3>
<p>If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot be<br>
given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall apply local<br>
law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil liability in<br>
connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies<br>
a copy of the Program in return for a fee.</p>
<p><em>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</em></p>
<h2 id="how-to-apply-these-terms-to-your-new-programs">How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</h2>
<p>If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to<br>
the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which everyone<br>
can redistribute and change under these terms.</p>
<p>To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach them<br>
to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of warranty;<br>
and each file should have at least the “copyright” line and a pointer to<br>
where the full notice is found.</p>
<div class="copy-wrapper"><div class="copy" title="Copy Code to Clipboard"><i class="icon small">content_copy</i></div><pre><code>&lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;

<p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.</p>
<p>If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this<br>
when it starts in an interactive mode:</p>

<p>The hypothetical commands <code>show w</code> and <code>show c</code> should show the appropriate parts of<br>
the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be different;<br>
for a GUI interface, you would use an “about box”.</p>
<p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if any, to<br>
sign a “copyright disclaimer” for the program, if necessary. For more<br>

<p>The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into<br>

more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If this is<br>
