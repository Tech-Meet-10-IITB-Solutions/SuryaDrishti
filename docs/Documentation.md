# Documentation

*AstroNetra* is a standalone web-based application using *Python* and *Angular* to identify X-ray bursts and categorise them based on peak energy flux and temperature. Given data includes long-duration X-ray light curve. Parameters like rise and decay time have also been derived and false minima have been kept to the minimum. 

*AstroNetra* is being developed to visualise a catalogue of sources, browse *XSM* observations and relevant papers to facilitate research based on *XSM* data. The target audience is the astronomy community but anyone interested in working with *XSM* data is very welcome to propose new features. 

*AstroNetra* provides utilities to:
- Visualise and analyse light curve data in the X-ray regime
- Identify solar flares and fit them to a curve
- Summarise properties such as the duration of the burst, the peak photon count, etc.
- Access relevant papers based on the object under consideration

Possible use-case scenarios:
- Study X-ray bursts from XSM data
- Study past successful proposals and studies to propose new observations
- Have fun finding patterns in the data using the visualisation tool (no pre-requisites)
