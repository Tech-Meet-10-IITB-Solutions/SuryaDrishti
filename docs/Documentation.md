# Documentation

*AstroNetra* is a standalone web-based application using *Python* and *Angular* to identify X-ray bursts and categorise them based on peak energy flux and temperature given long-duration X-ray light curve. Parameters like rise and decay time have also been derived and false positives have been kept to the minimum. It is primarily being developed to browse *XSM* observations and visualise solar flares to facilitate research based on *XSM* data but the target audience also includes the larger astronomy community. 

*AstroNetra* provides utilities to:
- Visualise and analyse light curve data in the X-ray regime
- Identify solar flares and fit them to a curve
- Summarise properties such as the duration of the burst, the peak photon count, etc.

Possible use-case scenarios:
- Study X-ray bursts from XSM data
- Aid in establishing a relationship (or the lack thereof) between solar flares and coronal mass ejections
- Combine with spectroscopy data to comprehensively analyse solar bursts
- Have fun finding patterns in the data using the visualisation tool (assumes no pre-requisites)
