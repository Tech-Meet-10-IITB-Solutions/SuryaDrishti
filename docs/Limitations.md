# Limitations

1. Cannot detect multi-bursts
2. The emission measure and total radiative loss calculations may fail for high intensity bursts
3. Does not currently support extensive scientific data visualisations
4. The system employs a simple user interface with lack of features that *pop*
5. Limited to deployment on linux-based servers
